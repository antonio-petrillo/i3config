#+title: i3wm config

* Why another dotfiles?
Lately I lost interest on ricing my machine, I think that I've spend to much time on that with the result that I'm never satisfied.
So why another dots for i3?
For the last month I've used gnome and after changing some keybindings, and also add some autostart, I can use it.
The problem is that emacs crash to often on wayland and if I'm obligated to use Xorg I will use wm.
I3 is always reliable, I think I've made this config in less than 15 minutes.
It's not good enough for /Uniporn/, but it's very usable.
Until Emacs will become stable (I've compiled fro source and I could have made some major bullshit, but on Xorg don't crash so...) on wayland I stick with Xorg.
When emacs will be ready I will try again with something like hyperland or sway.
